# Online-Accommodation-Hospitality-Services


The project revolves around designing a database system for an online accommodation and hospitality company service.  We achieve this by designing the database, inserting sample data and implement a set of required features. Each feature will be implemented as one or more Oracle PL/SQL procedures.
